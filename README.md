Introducing myself
## 🙋‍♂️ Who Am I?

Hey there! I’m **Kim Hyojae**, 15 years old, and a student developer from **Naegok Middle School**, Korea.

I love blending creativity with code — especially when working on **AI**, **apps**, or fun **school projects**.

Whether it’s sorting waste with image recognition or connecting APIs to visualize data, I enjoy learning by building!

Always curious. Always coding. 🚀
